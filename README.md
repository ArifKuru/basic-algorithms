# basic-algorithms
In my first semester, I wrote some basic algorithms during my introduction to programming lectures.
This repo contains
-Project-1 Prime Number
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 with only two factors – themselves and 1. 
A prime number cannot be divided by any other numbers without leaving a remainder. An 
example of a prime number is 13. It can only be divided by 1 and 13.
Write a program that takes a number from a user and finds greatest prime number smaller 
than the given number. According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. 
Program terminates when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not 
forget to control suitability of user’s input
-Project-2 Composite Number
A composite number is a positive integer that can be formed by multiplying two smaller positive 
integers. Equivalently, it is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. 
An example of a composite number is 6. It can be divided by not only 1 and 6 but also by 2 
and 3.
Write a program that takes a number from a user and finds smallest composite number greater 
than the given number. According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. 
Program terminates when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not 
forget to control suitability of user’s input
-Project-3 Twisted Prime Number
A number is said to be twisted prime if it is a prime number and reverse of the number is also 
a prime number. An example of a twisted prime number is 13 because both 13 and 31 are 
prime numbers.
Write a program that takes a number from a user and controls whether it is twisted prime or 
not. According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. Program terminates 
when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not forget to control 
suitability of user’s input.
-Project-4 Coprime Numbers
Co-prime numbers are the numbers whose common factor is only 1. There should be a 
minimum of two numbers to form a set of co-prime numbers. Such numbers have only 1 as 
their highest common factor, for example, {4 and 7}, {5, 7, 9} are co-prime numbers. Co-prime 
numbers need not be prime numbers always.
Write a program that takes two numbers from a user and controls whether they are coprime or 
not. According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. Program terminates 
when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not forget to control 
suitability of user’s input.
-Project-5 Ugly Number
Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. For instance, 300 is ugly 
number because 300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5.
Write a program that takes a number from a user and controls whether it is ugly or not. 
According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. Program terminates 
when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not forget to control 
suitability of user’s input.
